New Java Project
**Have a package structure that makes sense**
Make 2 beans
Make a driver class (class that has the main method)

Driver class- utilize each type of control statement
              utilize a wrapper class
              Overload the same method 3 times
              Utilize the Scanner to take in user input to instantiate objects
                ex. If you have a Human object, take in user input to instantiate the Human object's name etc.
              Instantiate 2 objects of each type.
